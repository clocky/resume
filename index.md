# Mark McLaughlin

## Summary

I'm an experienced design leader with over 20 years background creating user interfaces for web, mobile web, native applications and consumer electronics.

During that time I've collaborated with designers, artists, product managers and developers to deliver compelling and user-friendly applications for almost every consumer electronics platform and mode of interaction - whether it's phones, tablets, desktop PC's, augmented reality, smart TV's or game consoles.

Starting off as a self-taught designer I've been fortunate enough to have a career that's shipped products that have solved problems as diverse as entertaining hordes of teenage pop fans, helping millions of iPad users communicate with their loved ones, and most recently, enabling NASA to collaborate with astronauts on the International Space Station.
