headline: Optimising a 10-foot interface across locales
text:
  - I collaborated in a managerial and review capacity with the LG design team 
    in Seoul, South Korea both on site and remotely
  - The biggest challenges were around customization of their native grid UI 
    paradigm to fit both Western and Asian language usage scenarios - at the 
    time of engagement, the product was optimised entirely for Korean character 
    sets.
