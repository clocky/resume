text:
  - I acted as a remote design manager for the Samsung applications design team 
    in Suwon, South Korea to help build out a Skype application for their 
    flagship LED 8000 series TV's.
  - The primary goal for the project was to strike a balance between the 
    Skype brand and the native Samsung TV UI, with a secondary goal of making 
    use of hardware keys on the remote control to map to frequent actions â€” 
    for example green and red buttons to accept and decline incoming calls.
