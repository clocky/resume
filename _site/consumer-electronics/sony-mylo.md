  - Co-developed with Sony's hardware team, I worked in an interaction design
    role, overseeing the implementation of the integrated Skype client on the
    second-generation mylo device.
  - Customising Skype's interface to fit Sony's XMB (Cross-Media Bar) was a
    challenge, especially as Sony had underestimated the extent of the Skype
    functionality available, including calling landlines.
