  - During the transition of the Visual Studio Team Services product to the
    rebranded Azure DevOps suite, I managed the team that oversaw the roll
    out of a refreshed design system and feel, building on Microsoft's Fabric
    framework.
  - Taking the opportunity of the rebrand, we worked with our engineering 
    and product management stakeholders across Raleigh, San Francisco, Seattle
    and Hyderabad to enumerate the typical stock screens and scenarios that
    were common throughout the suite, in order normalize and bring coherency
    to the individual product workflows.

        | With the rollout of the design system, I took the opportunity to standardise
        | the team on use of Figma as our source of truth, helping reduce the amount of
        | time wasted by designers replicating known specifications by constantly 
        | redrawing the interface of the product in their own personal design systems
        | in Sketch, Adobe XD or even Visio.

        | As the first team at Microsoft to adopt Figma for a shipping product, our use of
        | Team Libraries in a distributed team was groundbreaking within Microsoft. As
        | part of our learning, I personally helped introduce Figma to multiple design
        | teams across Microsoft, by running workshops and brown bag sessions for
        | designers of all abilities across Azure, Windows and Office teams.

        | As of 2019, our initial Figma deployment of 80 editors has now scaled to 
        | 4,000 active editors across various Microsoft design organisations.
