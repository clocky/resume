  - During the transition of the Visual Studio Team Services product to the
    rebranded Azure DevOps suite, I managed the team that oversaw the roll
    out of a refreshed design system and feel, building on Microsoft's Fabric
    framework.
  - Taking the opporunity of the rebrand, we worked with our engineering 
    and product management stakeholders across Raleigh, San Francisco, Seattle
    and Hyderabad to enumerate the typical stock screens and scenarios that
    were common throughout the suite, in order normalize and bring coherency
    to the individual product workflows.
