  - The brief was simple - how do you make a Skype for Business client fit into
    the workflow of a typical Outlook user, but still make it feel like it was
    part of Office 365 all along?
  - Myself and the team took particular care to align typography, grids and even
    themes to ensure that the Skype app felt at home alongside e-mail, but also
    respected the environment it was in and any customisation choices that the
    user had made.
