  - I worked in webmaster capacity working with Kenny G and his management to 
    refresh kennyg.com with tour dates and news updates.
  - The novelty at the time was using Flash to automatically play sound clips 
    of both Kenny talking and playing short snippets of music within a 
    navigation based around his love of the soprano saxophone.
