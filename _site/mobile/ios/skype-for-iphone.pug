 -  Working closely within the iOS HIG guidelines, the team built out an app
    that was familiar to existing iPhone users with little learning curve from
    the native application, while working carefully around app store and carrier
    limitations.
 - Throughout my time leading the design of the iPhone app, the product was 
   consistently in the Top 10 of the App Store charts, only ever outsold
   by such other popular free apps of the time, such as Angry Birds and Pandora.
