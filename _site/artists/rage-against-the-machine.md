    - Over the course of 1999 and 2000 I was the Webmaster for Rage Against The 
      Machine, designed in co-operation from 
      Tom Morello to promote both the music and the message behind it.
    - A large amount of the content was unique, creating archives of 
      previously unpublished artwork as well as interviews with activists 
      and causes that the band supported, including the Zapatista, Mumia Abu-Jamal and Leonard Peltier.
    - The site won an award for “Best Artist Site” in the 2000 Wammy awards 
      from the Academy of Digital Music Arts and Sciences.
