    - After sharing office space with Ignition Management in London, best known
      for being the long-time managers of Oasis, I was asked by Marcus Russell
      to put together a small site for one of their other artists, 
      Mercury Rev.

    - Supporting their standout album, “Deserter’s Songs” (NME's 1998 Album of 
      the Year) and with a group of musicians who were almost famously 
      computer-phobic, the site featured pages of handwritten messages and 
      scans of artifacts and ephemera they’d picked up along their tours over 
      the years.
