text:
 - The project was in collaboration with their film offshoot Python Monty 
   Pictures to bring Eric Idle’s — but especially Terry Gilliam’s — artwork to 
   life as part of the overall brand and theme.
 - Working with the Python management team was erratic and entertaining; there
   was incredible openness to sharing dozens of files of scanned in Gilliam 
   artwork used on the original BBC shows, yet little or no direction on ongoing 
   content, other than the occasional Eric Idle tour plug.
