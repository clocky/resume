            | I was responsible for all aspects of the design, from defining interactions that respect the alternative input modes using the Kinect, gamepad and media remotes as well as a refreshed visual design that adapted content more appropriately for a 10ft interface, while respecting common TV screen settings.

        p A key challenge during the development cycle was the deprecation of the Kinect accessory, removing the ability to use skeletal tracking to correctly crop the video to focus on the speaker â€” but enabling Xbox owners to use any regular USB webcam.

        p I proposed an alternate scheme where the analog triggers and sticks on the Xbox controller could be used to permit fine-grained control of the local video cropping, taking cues from how Xbox owners frequently interact with in-game objects such as weapons. 

        p Built in Framer, it helped sell the idea to stakeholders in both product management and engineering, especially helping with estimation of development effort.
