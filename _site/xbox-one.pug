abstract: Visual, motion and interaction design for the refreshed Skype on Xbox One universal application (UWP).
text:
  - I was responsible for all aspects of the design, from defining interactions 
    that respect the alternative input modes using the Kinect, gamepad and media 
    remotes as well as a refreshed visual design that adapted content more 
    appropriately for a 10ft interface, while respecting common TV screen settings.

            | A key challenge during the development cycle was the 
            a(href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-one-without-kinect-shipping-j-1575644372")  deprecation of the Kinect accessory
            | , removing the ability to use skeletal 
            | tracking to correctly crop the video to focus on the speaker â€” 
            | but enabling Xbox owners to use any regular USB webcam.

        p 
            | I proposed an alternate scheme where the analog triggers and 
            | sticks on the Xbox controller could be used to permit fine-grained 
            |control of the local video cropping, taking cues from how Xbox 
            | owners frequently interact with in-game objects such as weapons. 

        p 
            | Built in Framer, it helped sell the idea to stakeholders in both 
            | product management and engineering, especially helping with 
            | estimation of development effort.
