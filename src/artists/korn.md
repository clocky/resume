text:
 - What started off as a personal fan project to help me learn HTML, ended up 
   becoming the  primary fan site for the pioneering nü-metal band, Korn and 
   ultimately led to me running the official site full-time in Los Angeles.
 - Over the course of several album launches from 1996 through to 2000, I took 
   care of every aspect of the overall site design. From being a full time 
   community manager for the forums, uploading photography and tour dates, 
   encoding promo videos to RealPlayer (in the world before YouTube) and even 
   moderating live chats with the band while they were out on tour.
 - In late 1999 in respect of my contributions to the "Follow the Leader" album, 
   I was presented with an RIAA Platinum Disc celebrating 2,000,000 copies sold
   of "Follow The Leader" — one of only a handful created for 
   the band, the production team and myself.
