text:
 - I was the Interaction designer, then design manager for the Skype for iPad 
   client, recognised by Apple in 2013 as the most downloaded free iPad 
   application of all time.
 - After initial explorations with the form, myself and the team committed to 
   the split view pattern to give familiarity to users of the desktop 
   application while re-using much of the phone client patterns in the left-hand
   navigation.
