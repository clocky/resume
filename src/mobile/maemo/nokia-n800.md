text:
- Working with Nokia's Maemo (later, MeeGo) team in Helsinki, Finland, I was the
  interaction designer for a standalone Skype application on their N800 and N810
  "Internet Tablet" devices.
- There were some unique aspects of the project in terms of keeping a somewhat
  familiar Windows feel to  the application - it was loosely based on our
  Windows Mobile app - while ensuring the app worked equally well with the
  hardware keys and the in-box stylus.
