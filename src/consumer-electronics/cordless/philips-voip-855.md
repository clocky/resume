 - VOIP855 is a DECT cordless phone with Skype that works without a PC, 
   offering consumers total flexibility and independence from the PC.
text: 
 - Collaborating with the Philips hardware team in France and Hong Kong, I 
   designed the interface for their VOIP851 cordless phone and answering machine.
 - Particular care was taken on adhering to standard Philips DECT phone UI paradigms, 
   due to customer loyalty to the brand. Additional adaptations were made for 
   individual regions such as APAC, EMEA and North America.
 - Until the original P2P network was sunset, the cordless phone range at Skype 
   consistently produced the highest ARPU across all of Skype's software and 
   hardware clients.
