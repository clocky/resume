## Evolving a label-driven site into a fan-driven site

Working with Los Angeles management team The Firm, I took on what started as a
freelance and ultimately a full-time role managing the Backstreet Boys website
as they prepared to release their breakthrough "Millennium" album in the USA.

Despite having little background into the band, it became obvious within the
first month of feedback through e-mail and forums that the fans just wanted
content, content and more content - anything and everything from anywhere.

The result was countless hours spent scanning unused 35mm slides from photo and
video shoots; detailed timetables showing every on-screen TV appearance (i.e.
Total Request Live) and of course in-depth minutiae and trivia on every band
member.
