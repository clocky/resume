text:
 - Working with Los Angeles management team The Firm, I took on what started as 
   a freelance and ultimately a full-time role managing the Backstreet Boys 
   website as they prepared to release their breakthrough "Millennium" album 
   in the USA.
 - Despite having little background into the band, it became obvious within the 
   first month of feedback through e-mail and forums that the fans just wanted 
   content, content and more content - anything and everything from anywhere.
 - The result was countless hours spent scanning unused 35mm slides from photo 
   and video shoots; detailed timetables showing every on-screen TV appearance 
   (i.e. Total Request Live) and of course in-depth minutiae and trivia on 
   every band member.
