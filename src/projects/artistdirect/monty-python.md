## Monty Python's Big White Site

The project was in collaboration with their film offshoot Python Monty Pictures
to bring Eric Idle’s — but especially Terry Gilliam’s — artwork to life as part
of the overall brand and theme.

Working with the Python management team was erratic and entertaining; there was
incredible openness to sharing dozens of files of scanned in Gilliam artwork
used on the original BBC shows, yet little or no direction on ongoing content,
other than the occasional Eric Idle tour plug.

The main menu illustration below was hand-coloured by myself.
