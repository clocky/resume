text:
  - The project was in collaboration with their film offshoot Python Monty 
    Pictures to bring Eric Idle’s — but especially Terry Gilliam’s — artwork to 
    life as part of the overall brand and theme.
  - Working with the Python management team was erratic and entertaining; there
    was incredible openness to sharing dozens of files of scanned in Gilliam 
    artwork used on the original BBC shows, yet little or no direction on ongoing 
    content, other than the occasional Eric Idle tour plug.
  - The main menu illustration below was hand-coloured by myself.
