  - Following an idle conversation where it turned out I was the only person in
    the ARTISTdirect office in Los Angeles to have heard of STEPS, I embarked
    on a two year journey working with "superfan" Jack Wallington and their
    management at Byrne Blood.
  - As an group focused around larger-than-life personalities and a strong set
    of radio-friendly singles, the site went through an overhaul with every
    ongoing variant of their brand, which changed on every release.
  - Of particular note, I spent many, many hours breaking down TIF files from
    photo shoots to create animated GIFs of the bands signature dance moves, (i.e,
    their "STEPS").
