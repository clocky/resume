## Promoting social change

I worked directly with the Indigo Girls management team to put together a
small site to support the launch of the 1999 album "Come On Now Social"
{.lead}

Similar to my work with [Rage Against The Machine](/artists/rage-against-the-machine/), there was brilliant input
from both Amy Ray and Emily Saliers to get the site to focus as much on 
their activism and supporting their personal causes as much as the music.
