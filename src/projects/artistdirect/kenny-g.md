## The world's first and last soprano saxophone navigation

I worked in a webmaster capacity working with Kenny G and his management to
refresh [kennyg.com](https://www.kennyg.com) with tour dates and news updates.

The novelty at the time was using Flash to automatically play sound clips of
both Kenny talking and playing short snippets of music within a navigation based
around his love of the soprano saxophone.
