## Hand-written ephemera and Americana

After sharing office space with Ignition Management in London, best known for
being the long-time managers of Oasis, I was asked by the legendary music
manager Marcus Russell to put together a small site for one of their other
artists, Mercury Rev. {.lead}

Supporting their standout album, “Deserter’s Songs” — [NME's 1998 Album of the
Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME_Album_of_the_Year) — and with a group of
musicians who were almost famously computer-phobic, the site featured pages of
handwritten messages and scans of artifacts and ephemera they’d picked up along
their tours and travels over the years.
