## Activism and archives

Over the course of 1999 and 2000 I was the Webmaster for Rage Against The
Machine, designed in co-operation from Tom Morello to promote both the music and
the message behind it.

A large amount of the content was unique, creating archives of previously
unpublished artwork as well as interviews with activists and causes that the
band supported, including the Zapatista, Mumia Abu-Jamal and Leonard Peltier.

In the wake of their "Battle of Los Angeles" album promotion cycle, my work on
the site won an award for “Best Artist Site” in the 2000 Wammy awards from the
Academy of Digital Music Arts and Sciences.
