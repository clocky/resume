## Sublime and ridiculous

Working with the artist liaison at ARTISTdirect, I maintained the ongoing online
presence for the Long Beach Dub Allstars, the band formed by the members of
Sublime after the untimely passing of singer Bradley Nowell.

The site was an abomination of pop-up windows and Flash 4 content based around
the tattoos of one of the band members. Sadly, the contents appear to have been
lost to a ZIP disk sometime in the early 2000's.

It's probably for the best. Here's the album cover, which will give you a sense
of what you're missing.
