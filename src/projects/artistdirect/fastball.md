## This is The Way

Buoyant from their success of breakout singles "The Way" and "Out Of My Head"
from the 1998 album "All The Pain Money Can Buy", I worked with Fastball's
management team to pull together a retro themed site to support the lanch of
their 2000 release, "The Harsh Light Of Day"
{.lead}

If my memory serves me correctly, the entire brief for this site was something
along the lines of the word "diner" and possibly "Americana" for good measure.
