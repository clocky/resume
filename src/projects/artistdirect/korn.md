## From fan-site to full-time

What started off as a personal fan project to help me learn HTML, ended up
becoming the  primary fan site for the pioneering nü-metal band, Korn and
ultimately led to me running the official site full-time in Los Angeles. {.lead}

Over the course of several album launches from 1996 through to 2000, I took care
of every aspect of the overall site design. From being a full time community
manager for the forums, uploading photography and tour dates, encoding promo
videos to RealPlayer (in the world before YouTube) and even moderating live
chats with the band while they were out on tour.

In late 1999 in respect of my contributions to the "Follow the Leader" album, I
was presented with an RIAA Platinum Disc celebrating 2,000,000 copies sold of
the record — one of only a handful created for the band, the production team and
myself.
