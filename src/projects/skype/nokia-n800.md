## The first ever Skype tablet client

Working with Nokia's Maemo (later, MeeGo) team in Helsinki, Finland, I was the
interaction designer for a standalone Skype application on their N800 and N810
"Internet Tablet" devices.

There were some unique aspects of the project in terms of keeping a somewhat
familiar Windows feel to  the application - it was loosely based on our
Windows Mobile app - while ensuring the app worked equally well with the
hardware keys and the in-box stylus.
