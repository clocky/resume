## Balancing native and branded UI

I acted as a remote design manager for the Samsung applications design team in
Suwon, South Korea to help build out a Skype application for their flagship LED
8000 series TV's.

The primary goal for the project was to strike a balance between the Skype brand
and the native Samsung TV UI, with a secondary goal of making use of hardware
keys on the remote control to map to frequent actions â€” for example green and
red buttons to accept and decline incoming calls.
