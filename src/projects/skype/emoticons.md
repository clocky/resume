## Upscaling a core brand element

The launch of high DPI devices in 2011 such as the iPhone 4 and Motorola Droid
pushed the mobile team at Skype into moving beyond simple pixel-doubling
and a realization that a total overhaul was necessary to futureproof the
work across multiple platforms.

As a team this was a huge task over several months â€” as a design team, we had to
consider and make informed decisions on pixels vs. vectors; the arrangement of
the emoticon palette on different form factors, the merits of PNG and SVG-T;
balancing line weights at different sizes and most crucially of all, keeping a
sense of the original set without drifting too much into 'quirky'.

### Extending and animating {.mt-5}

Jon talks more about the overall process of creating the static images [in his
journal](https://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/new-skype-emoticons), and at a later
date we engaged with the absurdly talented [Julian
Frost](http://julianfrost.co.nz/work/skypeemoticons/) to take the spirit of
Jon's work and create animated versions for those platforms that supported it.

Here's a few of the standouts that I especially enjoyed working with Julian and
the team on. Sadly (but possibly for the best) not all of these survived the
Microsoft acquisition.

### Julian's Muse {.mt-5}

Along the way in any design process, there's always a few memorable moments that
get lost to history, but this is one that we were fortunate to capture for
future generations - the history of the Skype `(dance)` emoticon:

Our colleague, [Mark Lacroce](http://marklacroce.com) is captured here offering
up his take on the Carlton and other moves; after, Julian brings it to life.
