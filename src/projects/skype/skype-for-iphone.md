## Blending desktop and mobile paradigms

Working closely within the iOS HIG guidelines, the team built out an app that
was familiar to existing iPhone users with little learning curve from the native

Throughout my time leading the design of the iPhone app, the product was
consistently in the Top 10 of the App Store charts, only ever outsold by such
other popular free apps of the time, such as Angry Birds and Pandora.
