## Integrating remote control design

The core efforts were to update their bespoke television UI to fit the Skype
branding, iconography and color schemes while considering how the remote control
soft-keys could be mapped to frequently used actions within the app.

Panasonic took the lead on the design, while I acted in an advisory capacity,
as many of their design decisions were based on seemingly arbitrary information
they'd found from other Skype clients.

### Marketing

To my delight, Panasonic also created this fabulously bonkers promotional video
for the app. I don't think my work has had a more exotic soundtrack.
