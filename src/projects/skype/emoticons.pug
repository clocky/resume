text:
  - The launch of high DPI devices in 2011 such as the iPhone 4 and Motorola Droid
    pushed the mobile team at Skype into moving beyond simple pixel-doubling
    and a realization that a total overhaul was necessary to futureproof the
    work across multiple platforms.
  - As a team this was a huge task over several months â€” as a design team, we had to consider and
    make informed decisions on pixels vs. vectors; the arrangement of the
    emoticon palette on different form factors, the merits of PNG and SVG-T;
    balancing line weights at different sizes and most crucially of all, keeping
    a sense of the original set without drifting too much into 'quirky'.

          | Jon talks more about the overall process of creating the static images  
          a(href="https://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/new-skype-emoticons") in his journal
          |, and at a later date we engaged with the absurdly talented 
          a(href="http://julianfrost.co.nz/work/skypeemoticons/") Julian Frost 
          | to take the spirit of Jon's work and create animated versions for those 
          | platforms that supported it.

          | Sadly (but possibly for the best) not all of these survived the Microsoft acquisition.
