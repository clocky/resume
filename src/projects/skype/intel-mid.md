## An early iteration of the tablet form

Intel's UMD (Ultra Mobility Device) group engaged with my team to produce a beta
application for their experimental MID concept, porting the Skype codebase to a
Linux embedded version. {.lead}

This early version of the application was announced at CES in 2008, but a lack
of market interest and the arrival of the iPad in 2010 closed this project soon
thereafter.
