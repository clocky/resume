## Aligning consumer and enterprise needs

I co-developed a unified presence model to align the Skype consumer products and
the legacy Lync clients into one cohesive system across both brands.

One of the core principals was to understand the intent of the user from
inferred behaviours that could be determined using sensors, when they do not
explicitly set a presence - for example, if a mobile device reports that it's
connected to a car.

The second and perhaps most crucial part, was to ensure that the visual 
representation of presence states was immediate and glanceable, even for those
users that may have visual impairments.

It was hugely important that the system was accessible and adaptable across
different Microsoft properties, as well as referencing legacy presence models to
ease the transition.

### Signalling

Particular time and effort was spent understanding the granular requirements of
enterprise users and the unique ways they adapt presence for their own specific
industries. In short - if I had a real life human assistant, how would they
share the likelihood of getting my attention?

I worked with stakeholders in London and Redmond, and spent time on key customer
sites in such as [Emirates](https://www.emirates.com/us/english/) in Dubai and
[AB Volvo](https://www.volvogroup.com) in Gothenburg to really understand the
real-life usage, particularly in enterprise scenarios.
