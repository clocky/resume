  - Announced at CeBIT 2009 and years ahead of the video-calling home appliance
    revival with Amazon's Alexa Show and Facebook's portal, I was the sole
    interaction designer for the Asus EEE Videophone AiGuru SV-1, the original 
    entry into the hardware video calling market.
  - Focusing on a core persona of a less technically-savvy user, likely to be
    a parent or grandparent, the team and I built a ground-up embedded Linux
    interface that made the use of the prevalent hardware at the time.
  - The challenges of keeping things as simple and plug-and-play as possible 
    while masking a Linux kernel underneath were fun to address, not to mention
    how much we learned from Asus about hardware design, acoustic modelling and a 
    circuit-board level detail of the screens we designed for.
