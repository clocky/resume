## The first video-calling focused home appliance

Announced at CeBIT 2009 and years ahead of the video-calling home appliance
revival with Amazon's Alexa Show and Facebook's portal, I was the sole
interaction designer for the Asus EEE Videophone AiGuru SV-1, the original entry
into the hardware video calling market. {.lead}

Focusing on a core persona of a less technically-savvy user, likely to be
a parent or grandparent, the team and I built a ground-up embedded Linux
interface that made the use of the prevalent hardware at the time.

The challenges of keeping things as simple and plug-and-play as possible while
masking a Linux kernel underneath were fun to address, not to mention how much
we learned from Asus about hardware design, acoustic modelling and a
circuit-board level detail of the screens we designed for.
