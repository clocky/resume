  - Developed in co-operation with the Hutchison Whampoa global handset team,
    the "3 Skypephone" was the first ever integrated Skype experience on a
    mobile device, only possible by co-operating with a forward-looking mobile
    operator.
  - Collaborating directly with Amoi, the handset OEM, the team at Skype created 
    custom iconography that mapped to the default style of the phone.
  - The core technology was based on a Qualcomm-powered BREW client developed
    by iSkoot in Israel; over the course of multiple in-person workshops in
    Jerusalem and London, the team created a first-class embedded client that
    seamlessly moved between PSTN and VoIP calling.
  - The device was launched globally in 2007 across all of 3's core markets in
    the UK, Sweden, Italy and Australia and was awarded a "Highly Commended" 
    rating in the 2008 GSMA awards in the the Best Mobile Handset or Device category.
