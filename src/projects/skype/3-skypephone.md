## The first integrated Skype cellphone experience

Developed in co-operation with the Hutchison Whampoa global handset team,
the "3 Skypephone" was the first ever integrated Skype experience on a
mobile device, only possible by co-operating with a forward-looking mobile
operator.

Collaborating directly with Amoi, the handset OEM, the team at Skype created
custom iconography that mapped to the default style of the phone.

The core technology was based on a Qualcomm-powered BREW client developed
by iSkoot in Israel; over the course of multiple in-person workshops in
Jerusalem and London, the team created a first-class embedded client that
seamlessly moved between PSTN and VoIP calling.

The device was launched globally in 2007 across all of 3's core markets in the
UK, Sweden, Italy and Australia and was awarded a "Highly Commended" rating in
the 2008 GSMA awards in the the Best Mobile Handset or Device category.
