## Integrating Skype into the native experience

Back in the era of the iPhone 3GS, I was the interaction designer at Skype
tasked with helping theteam at Palm integrate Skype their WebOS range - first
with the Verizon launch of the Palm Pre 2, and then later with the short-lived
HP TouchPad. {.lead}

Exclusive to Verizon and building on the infrastructure in the BlackBerry
applications I'd worked on earlier, the premise was simple - Skype to Skype
calls would be free, domestic calls would route over Verizon's network, but any
international calls would be hosted by Skype's PSTN service.

### HP Touchpad {.mt-1}

Soon after the acquisition of Palm by HP, we collaborated again on the
integrated calling experiencer for this new tablet form factor. As some sort of
personal record. The device was announced in Feburary 2011, released in July
2011 and withdrawn from sale 49 days later.

While I'd love to claim some design genius here, the Skype calling experience
was essentially the iPad client rendered in Avenir, with concessions to the
webOS system controls from the Palm Pre phone app.
