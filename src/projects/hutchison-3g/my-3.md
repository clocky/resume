## Empowering customers to be in control 

I designed and contributed to the development the front end UI for a self-care
portal for a Hutchison 3G (aka, "3 mobile") that allowed customers to review,
manage and top-up their accounts from both their desktop and mobile devices.

This was exceptionally novel at the time; the challenges in development included
creating separate views for not just desktop and mobile users, but multiple
variants for every mobile phone that was ranged by the carrier, inherently
complex in the years before responsive design and modern web standards.

Cost implications to the business were enormous, with a huge reduction in calls
to customer support as a result.
