## Skype ðŸ’• Office 365

The brief was simple - how do you make a Skype for Business client fit into the
workflow of a typical Outlook information worker, but still make it feel like it
was part of Office 365 all along? {.lead}

Myself and the team took particular care to align typography, grids and even
themes to ensure that the Skype app felt at home alongside e-mail, but also
respected the environment it was in and any customisation choices that the
user had made.
