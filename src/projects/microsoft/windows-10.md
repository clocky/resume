## Native communications for desktop and mobile

As part of the launch of Windows 10, one of the flagship features was to
integrate Skype directly into the native People, Messaging, Phone and a new
Video application - acting as a FaceTime and Hangouts competitor in the OS.

### Mobile

For mobile we took the approach of integration with the address book, allowing
users to automatically find friends who also used Skype. We also worked with the
Windows communications team to enable cost-conscious customers to switch between
Skype and SMS within a conversation as they saw fit.
