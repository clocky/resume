## Design systems for developer services

<p class="lead">
During the transition of the Visual Studio Team Services product to the
rebranded Azure DevOps suite, I managed the team that oversaw the roll out of a
refreshed design system and feel, building on Microsoft's Fabric framework.
</p>

Taking the opportunity of the rebrand, we worked with our engineering and
product management stakeholders across Raleigh, San Francisco, Seattle and
Hyderabad to enumerate the typical stock screens and scenarios that were common
throughout the suite, in order normalize and bring coherency to the individual
product workflows.

### Everything is a list, sort of.

One of the key discoveries during the exploration phase of the project was that
almost everything in the product operated on the concept of a list or collection
of objects - be they bugs, files, work items or test cases.

As a result, myself and the team took particular care in defining every known
scenario in the product for tabular data, and especially defining accessible and
visually differentiated styles for each type of object to be used throughout the
different parts of the product.

### Building and maintaining the content

During the development and implementation of the design system, we took
advantage of the recent acquisition of GitHub to create an open backlog that
allowed designers from all our locations to make requests and ask questions
asynchronously - and there are no stupid questions - with a dedicated designer
helping triage and understand requirements.

### Centralising design components in Figma

With the rollout of the design system, I took the opportunity to standardise the
team on use of Figma as our source of truth, helping reduce the amount of time
wasted by designers replicating known specifications by constantly redrawing the
interface of the product in their own personal design systems in Sketch, Adobe
XD or even in one case, Visio.

### Evangelising best practices

As the first design org at Microsoft to adopt Figma for a shipping product, our
use of Team Libraries in a distributed team was groundbreaking within the
company. As part of our learning, I personally helped introduce Figma to
multiple design teams across Redmond and Hyderabad, by running workshops and
brown bag sessions for designers of all abilities across Azure, Windows and
Office teams.

As of 2020, our initial Figma deployment of 80 editors has now scaled to 4,000
active editors across various Microsoft design organisations.
