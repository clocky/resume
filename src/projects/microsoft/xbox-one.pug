  - I was responsible for all aspects of the design, primarily defining interactions 
    that respected the alternative input modes using the Kinect, gamepad and media 
    remotes.
  - Additionally, I created a refreshed visual design that adapted content more 
    appropriately for a 10ft interface, while respecting common consumer TV screen settings.

                | A key challenge during the development cycle was the 
                a(href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-one-without-kinect-shipping-j-1575644372")  deprecation of the Kinect accessory
                | , removing the ability to use skeletal 
                | tracking to correctly crop the video to focus on the speaker â€” 
                | but enabling Xbox owners to use any regular USB webcam.

                | I proposed an alternate scheme where the analog triggers and 
                | sticks on the Xbox controller could be used to permit fine-grained 
                |control of the local video cropping, taking cues from how Xbox 
                | owners frequently interact with in-game objects such as weapons.

                | Built in Framer, it helped sell the idea to stakeholders in both 
                | product management and engineering, especially helping with 
                | estimation of development effort.
