            <p class="lead">I'm an experienced design leader with over 20 years background creating end-to-end experiences for web, mobile, native and consumer electronics.</p>
            <p>During that time I've collaborated with designers, artists, product managers and developers to deliver compelling and user-friendly apps for almost every consumer electronics platform and mode of interaction - whether it's phones, tablets, desktop PC's, augmented reality, smart TV's or game consoles.</p>
            <p>Starting off as a self-taught designer I've been fortunate enough to have a career that's shipped products that have solved problems as diverse as <a href="/artists/backstreet-boys/">entertaining hordes of teenage pop fans</a>, helping millions of iPad users <a href="/mobile/ios/ipad/">communicate with their loved ones</a>, and more recently, enabling NASA to <a href="/hardware/hololens/">collaborate with astronauts</a> on the International Space Station.</p>
