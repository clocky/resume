 - My team were responsible for building the companion experience for 
   remote participants and collaborating with the Windows Holographic 
   team for the native app.
 - While the holographic version of the application served as a showcase for
   permitting the user to share their Mixed Reality experience with a third 
   party, many of the design challenges were around how Windows users joining
   the HoloLens user could interact with a 3D space on a 2D input plane.

                | Within the Holographic UI are was taken how to consider the 
                | use of the Skype brand and 'flat' design within a 3D space. 
                | For example, I created an early prototype in Framer to get a 
                | sense of rendering gaze and hover states for call controls 
                | on a physical surface while using the Skype in-house icon style.

                | Working with the motion design team at Skype, care was taken 
                | to produce clear menu structures that would work in both 2D and 
                | 3D space, optimised for short distance movements with the users
